## Memory

RAM types:
- Static RAM ( SRAM )
	- fast but expensive
	- bigger in space
	- 6 transistors
	- stable, no refresh cycles needed
	- direct access
	- used in CPU caches
- Dynamic RAM ( DRAM )
	- cheaper but slower ( because capacitor need time to charge and discharge )
	- smaller in space
	- 1 capacitor + 1 transistor
	- need refresh the keep state
	- need address to access, hence need more time to read and wirte

DRAM
- SDRAM - Synchronous DRAM
- DDR - Data Rate DRAM

## CPU Caches

SRAM for CPUs.

- Spatial locality
- Temporal locality

## What programmer can do with memory?
