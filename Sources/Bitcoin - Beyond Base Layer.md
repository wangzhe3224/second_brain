[[Bitcoin]] community has a "slow" change culture, in return, Bitcoin network get stability and security. Other chains, such as [[Ethereum]], has a fast fail culture. Therefore Bitcoin serve as a stable base layer for other crypto applications. 

Some Bitcoin ecosystem:

- Lightning Network
- Liquid: layer-2 solution enabling the fast, confidential settlement and issuance of digital assets, such as stablecoins, security tokens, and other financial instruments, on top of the Bitcoin timechain.
- General Purpose Platform
	- RSK: 
	- Stacks: smart contract layer for Bitcoin tethered to it via a cross-chain consensus mechanism. Note this is still non-Truing complete, in exchange of less bug.

Some new concept:

- Merge mining from RSK
- New consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Transfer

Some concerns:

- Bridging BTC to its chain, such as RSK, Stack, exposes the same risk as porting BTC to Ethereum. 
- Bitcoin base layer is resistance to changes, whereas this may limit ability to develop some functions for top layers.
