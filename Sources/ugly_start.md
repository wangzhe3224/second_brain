> Creativity is not reserved for the exclusive use of those who image themselves in touch with the muses. It's the right and privilege of every human being.

Creativity, in the arts or otherwise, is about the everyday making of things. It is not about muses and inspiration, or bolts from the blue: it's about problem-solving and exploration. It is about risk and encounter with the unknowns.

start is always, almost urly. We fear ugly, so we never start. The hardest part is beginning in the face of these fears.

The creative process–the way we make things–is a step-
by-step process. It is iterative. One step leads to another. You can’t know what the whole dance looks like until you look back on it, to see how it all came together.

Don’t wait to be certain. Don’t wait until you’ve got it all figured out before you begin. Writers don’t think and then write; we write in order to think.

## The fear of ugly

_What I do fear is waste of time and no outcome from it_

But why we fear to start?

- laziness
  - social media is an easy out comparing to making new things.
- fear
  - what ifs
    - doesn't work out
    - total failures
    - been ignored
    - I can never finish it
    - I don't have time 

Leaning into fear, seeing where it leads, and one of the essential pillars of the creative life.

Courage is a choice to listen to the fear and to act in hopes of proving it wrong, and it is available to all of us, though “available” has never meant “easy.”

## The tyranny of perfection

The goal of perfect is a self-sabotaging goal, because we want to be perfect!

We must run to messy stuff.

## The danger of comparison

We have a compulsion to know where we stand in the world, not relative to who we are, but to the tribes to which we want to belong.

Solution: 

No, our task is to do the one thing that is within our control: to make things our way, and to make them unapologetically ours. And then to do it again and again.

we need to stop comparing ourselves to others. Our eyes must always be on our work.

> The great artists in the world share this one thing: they did their thing their way. They didn't measure what whey were doing by public opinion.

## The failure of should

In school system, we learned that there was a right way and a wrong way to do almost everything.

> If the first question we ask ourselves is, "How should I start this thing?" I think we are already doomed.
>

Solution

Replace obligation or any sense that there is a right or wrong way to do this, with possibility and questions that reflect that:

- what do you want to make?
- what would be interesting for you?
- exciting you?
- where is curiosity leading you?
- what crazy, bold, idea would you entertain?

Then look for more possibilities NOT answers.

## There is no map

it is human nature to want a map. 

Flow (心流) requires four things: time, attention, skill, and challenge.

Creativity, however else you want to define it, is ultimately just prob- lem solving. 

> Knowing how to get flow is much more important than knowing where you are going.

## Response: Ability

Creativity - the process of making things - is not linear, but it is iterative.
One idea leads to another, and that idea suggests something else. At each junction (you say failure, I say junction), we respond and make choices.

> When we are at the beginning, the only truly wrong choice is not starting.
> The final wondrous thing you make depends not so much on how you begin but that you begin it.

## Write drunk, edit sober

Our fears can push us in the direction we most need to go.

## Creators, not creatives

Ideas are still nothing but sparks in the brain until we flesh them out and get them into the real world.

## The value of bad ideas

If you throw out the bad ideas and do not give them a place to accumulate and age, you will have discarded some of the most treasured resources of the creative process.

## Small steps, little wins

Begin overwhelmed at the thought of even trying, or not knowing where to begin, is enemy number one.

## Distracted

Focus takes our work to new places; it gives us new ideas and connections, helps us avoid errors, and allows our brains to bring their A-game to what we do.

## Time - big rocks first

Time is a resource, and more valuable than money. You cannot store time, it just moves.
e
Ask yourself:

Do you need more time? If yes. then three options:

- trimming
- saving
- stop wasting

Most people get so little done because their available time gets cut up into pieces that are too small to use meaningfully.
The concept of batching things has changed the way I work and made me far more productive. 

if I need a day to do a particular thing, I do only that thing. If I need a week or a month, I make sure that the largest, uninterrupt- ed chunks of my day during that time are given to that one thing. 

you won’t get the important stuff in if you leave it for last. It never happens. Not with money, not with time. Every day, week, month, or year, consider the big rocks first. 

it probably means you need to find a way to do a little less of the trivial and the urgent and a little more of the important and the needful.

## The power of ritual and habit

This is one reason we break things down into the small- est pieces: to create small steps, avoid being overwhelmed, and find little wins.

Your ritual can be anything, but it must fit. it must work for you because thats the only thing matters.

## The power of constraints

Creative work doesn’t happen best without limits, but within them. 

Constraint trim down a bit the possibilities we created.

If you spend time deliberating over the small stuff, you will have nothing left for the decisions that actually matters.

When I begin writing a book, the faster I can get started on an outline (my big constraint), the faster I can get to the heart of the thing and find flow and momentum. 

Constraints:

- content
- time 

## Trust the process

(this is about making mistakes)

The making of anything is an evolutionary progression, and it would be very easy to get frustrated and discouraged if you didn’t understand that, embrace it fully, and throw yourself wildly into it.

Without a gradual accumulation of so-called mistakes, nothing evolves or moves forward.

## The power of failure

Your ugly start isn’t failure; it’s a promise—as long as you don’t abandon it but do the work and see where it leads.

## The problem of boredom

It probably helps to know that boredom is not always a bad thing.

Boredom is a lack of challenge—a mental space in which there is no fascination, no puzzle to solve, and no problem to overcome. 

This is really just another way of looking at the principle of constraints explored in Chapter 15. You’ve got to give yourself a problem to solve and a way to focus your energies. 

Boredom is the opposite of flow, and the missing ingre- dients are challenge and interest. Sometimes you need to set one project aside for a time and focus on something else, to let your interest return. Sometimes you need to begin something else to reintroduce the challenge.

## The problem of burnout

start ugly, gain momentum, find my groove, focus deeply, get into flow, and then finish with nothing left in reserve, having burned all the fuel that was available to me. 

## Beautiful endings

Nothing you create will ever emerge perfect or complete, but it will show up full of possibility if you will just start.

Starting ugly reverses that. It removes the threat of the imperfect and replaces it with the promise of evolution and eventual refinement. 

The magic, if there is any, is in the beginning.
