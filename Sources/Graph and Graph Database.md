[[Online Transaction Processing]], OLTP faces concurrent problem, [[Online Analytical Processing]], OLAP dealing with historical queries. [[Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing]], HTAP mix the two. 

[[Power Law]] 

Three types of problems that graph analytics and algorithms are used:
- Propagation pathways
- Flow and influences
- Interactions and resiliency

## Terms

`label` marks a node as part of a *group*. `relationship` are classified based on relation type. Node and relationship can have `properties`. 

A `subgraph` is a graph within a larger graph. A `path` is a group of nodes and their connecting relationships. 

## Graph types and Structures

Flavors of Graphs

- Connected vs Disconnected
- Weighted vs unweighted
- Directed vs undirected
- Cyclic vs acyclic
- Sparse vs dense
- Monopartite, Bipartiete, and k-partite

## Graph Algorithms

- Pathfinding
- Centrality
- Community Detection
