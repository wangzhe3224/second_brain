# On Stake and Consensus

by 

It is important to realise that while distributed consensus is a hard problem, ordinary consensus is much easier and better studied, and **can be solved some trillions of times more efficiently by use of trusted identifiable signing parties**. Therefore, cryptocurrencies which compromise by introducing trusted parties, **even under limited circumstances**, should consider whether their new trust model is one for which consensus is easily achieved by some other mechanism.

you cannot produce consensus except by consuming an external resource.

[[Proof of stake]] is the idea that we can use cryptographic proof, rather than physical arguments such as the Landauer limit, to demonstrate that some computation is costly.

Ultimately the problem is that the coins bonded against a stake signature only exist within the blockchain to which those coins belong. This means that if the blockchain can be cheaply created by some party, such a party can create multiple blockchains and select one which favors him.**If cheap histories are available to everyone, clearly the system is broken.**

it changes the trust model from that of Bitcoin. New users who encounter multiple histories are no longer able to distinguish them on their own; they need to ask existing participants in the network which history they know to be the true one. **This is not a distributed consensus**!

Ability to control the future selection of stakeholders as serious consequences.
