A **public key infrastructure** (**PKI**) is a set of roles, policies, hardware, software and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store and revoke [digital certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate "Public key certificate") and manage [public-key encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography "Public-key cryptography"). 

a PKI is an arrangement that _binds_ [public keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key "Public key") with respective identities of entities (like people and organizations). The binding is established through a process of registration and issuance of certificates at and by a [[Certificate Authority]] (CA).

A PKI may cover a single company, a group of companies, a company and its suppliers, general technological classes, etc.
