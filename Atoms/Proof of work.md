Proof of work

As it applies to Bitcoin, a proof of work is **a computational proof that some scarce resource was consumed.** Such a proof is possible because it appears that computational resources are physically bounded by available time, space and energy

A proof of work commits to some data, effectively "signing" it with some consumed resource.

## Why Proof of Work?

Such proofs are useful because they ensure **malicious actors are limited in their capacity to produce valid proofs of alternate histories**, giving the remaining actors sufficient time and bandwidth to come to consensus on a single history, **as long as they have more resources than the malicious ones.**

Bitcoinâ€™s main innovation was aligning economic incentives to discourage resource-rich actors from becoming malicious.

Users are able to achieve consensus not only of the transactions, but of their order in time.

Two algo consideration of PoW:
1. optimisation free
2. approximation free
