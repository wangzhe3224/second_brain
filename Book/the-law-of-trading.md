The Trading Laws:

---

- Know why you are doing the trade before you trade
- You are never happy with the amount you traded
- Take only the risks you're paid to take. Hedge the others
- If you can’t explain your edge in five minutes, you don’t have a very good
  one. (The long-term profitability of an edge is inversely proportional to how
  long it takes to explain it.)
- The model expresses the edge.
- If you think your costs are negligible relative to your edge, you’re wrong
  about at least one of them.
- Just because something has never happened doesn’t mean it can’t. 
- Working to align everyone’s interests is time well spent.
- If you don’t master technology and data, you’re losing to someone who does.
- If you’re not getting better, you’re getting worse.

- 交易之前明确这次交易的真正原因
- 你永远不会对成交量满意
- 承担你要承担的风险，对冲其他风险
- 如果你不能在 5 分钟内解释你的优势，那么你就是没有一个好的优势
    - 优势就是你知道或者能做到而别人不知道或者做不到的事情
- 模型是用来表达优势的
- 如果你觉得成本对你的优势而言可以忽略，那么你至少算错了其中一个东西
- 一个事情从未发生不代表它不会发生
- 双赢才重要
- 如果你不能掌握技术和数据，你就会输给掌握它们的人
- 如果你没有变的更好，你就变的更差了

The author not only explain those laws in trading context, but also in a common
sense life use cases.

The risk section is interesting and informative. We need to use multiple risk 
measures together instead of 1.

## Motivation

> Know why you are doing the trade before you trade

People have reason other than "make money" to trade:

- Need cash, so sell some stock
- By a insurance for your home which you know you will have negative return
  expectation. This is called `hedging`

The objective function of trading is not profit but _utility_.

Human bias:

- underestimate/overestimate small probabilities
- overestimate our knowledge and abilities
- think A and B occurring is more likely than A only occurring

Irrationality of human, this diverge us from our trading goal, gives wrong
reason to trade:

- Large emotional reaction
- Boredom
    - Trade because I want to do something...
- Addiction to trade
- Risk taking
- Want a big score
    - lose less win big (seems like)

Trading is not about you, it is about a relationship between you and the rest of
the world. The trading edges come from things that specifically and in
particular you know and can act upon that others cannot.

Create structural habits that strongly encourage good decision-making process
during trading.

Keep a record of reason before a trade is happening.

pre-commit the goal and take punishment if miss the goal.

## Adverse Selection

> You are never happy with the amount you traded

- all that matters is your knowledge __relative__ to other people trading with
  you
- the act of trading ( or not trading ) teaches you something you didn't know
  before

Bayesian reasoning: having beliefs and updating them.

- adverse selection rules the trading world
- combat adverse selection by specializing. Become an expert in your market!
- if you are forced to trade in unfamiliar market, then trade them using
  mechanisms with little price or size discrimination

## Risk

> Take only the risks you're paid to take. Hedge the others

Evaluate trades by two aspects: expected value and capital consumption (ie
margin).

What is risk??

It’s a mistake to rely on one specific view or measure of risk.

- standard deviation
- max drawdown
- skewness
- tail exponent
- value at risk

>> When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

measure can also be manipulated if used along.

Risk:

- Market risk
- Counterpart risk
- Liquidity risk
- Model risk
- Operational risk
- Technological risk
- Reputation and legal risk

what is the risk that I’m hedging against, exactly? and What is the most
cost-effective hedge?

Choose an offer:

- How bad would it be to lose the job in 12 month?
- How good would it be to become employee #5 at next Google?
- Probabilities of above
- Can I find some hedge?
    - Get in touch with the other hire manager?
    - By an job insurance?

## Liquidity

> Put on a risk using the most liquid instrument for that risk.

Who is in the market:

- Retail
- Fund Manager
- Big cash cow like Warren Buffet
- Market maker
- Pension fund manager
- Bond investor
- Arbitragers

Aspect of a trade:

- Spread
- Size
- Margin
- Specified

## Edge

Why do you think some trade make money? and this is the `edge`.

For most trades worth doing you need something more than data, something very
human indeed. 

all trades that have edge are profitable because there is some fact about the
world that you understand and can act on that the marginal participant in the
mar- ket doesn’t understand or can’t act on. Thus, describing your edge is
explaining what you know and can do, which others do not and cannot.

 All that matters is how good you are relative to the marginal participant in
 the market. Speaking loosely, all you have to be is “better than average.” This
 is obviously much easier than being the best.

 It’s more accurate to say that you have to be better than the trader of the
 median share.

 Poor or uninformed traders have two important characteristics:

 - don't trade a lot because of losing
 - don't last long

 In fact, the marginal trader in modern financial markets is quite sophisticated
 and skilled indeed.

 here are some well known edges:

 - market maker makes money by aggregate liquidity demand
 - when etf fund rebalance portfolio based on index composition, people provide
   liquidity to those fund makes money
 - relationship between related securities should follow certain reasonable
   statistical properties. 

A very complex edge with lots of moving parts is unlikely to be one that broadly
applicable to many situations and remain profitable over long term.

Simple stories are robust.

Why Apple is so successful whereas others are not? The edge-based explanation is
that Apple knows things and they can do things that others can’t. 

The notion of edge also applies at a personal level. Can you do what other
people cannot do? or can you do better than others?

Edge derives from something you know or can do that others in the market either
don’t know or can’t do.

## Models

> The model expresses the edge.

Good models are: 

- Robustness
    - ability to keep perform well
- Hardware, software, and wetware
    - working strategy is alway model + human thought
- Inspectablilty
    - Debug
    - Confidence
    - Iterative Improvement
    - Modular design
    - Good interfaces, ie clean and small

## Cost and Capacity

> If you think your costs are negligible relative to your edge, you’re wrong
> about at least one of them.

## Possibility

> Just because something has never happened doesn’t mean it can’t. 

Crazy things happen in financial markets all the time. And they will continue to
happen.

## Alignment

> Working to align everyone’s interests is time well spent.

## Technology

> If you don’t master technology and data, you’re losing to someone who does.

What matters more than the specifics of the software engineering paradigm, or
the framework used to implement it, is the sociology of its implementation.

## Adaptation

> If you’re not getting better, you’re getting worse.

What is getting better????

- Individual benefit
- Group benefit
- Firm benefit
