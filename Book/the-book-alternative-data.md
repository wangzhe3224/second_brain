## Factor Investing

### 1 Factor Model - CAPM

$$E[r_i] = r_f + \beta_{p,m}E[r_m - r_f]$$

where

- $r_i$ is the return of asset i
- $r_m$ is the return of market
- $r_f$ is the risk free rate
- $\beta_{p, m} = \rho_{p,m}\sigma_p/\sigma_m$
    - $\rho_{p,m}$ is the correlation of portfolio and market
    - $\sigma$ is the standard deviations of the portfolio and the market

### Factor Model

Marco, fundamental, and statistical assert pricing model.

### Arbitrage Pricing Theory - APT

Purely statistical model.
