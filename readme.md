# My Second (Plain Text) Brain

I inspired by [Molecular Notes: my Second Brain](https://reasonabledeviations.com/2022/04/18/molecular-notes-part-1/).

But I don't really like the idea using Obsidian (this is actually good) + Notion (bad because no local storage) + other stuff. 
I feel a plain text + some links + meta data are enough to achieve the function proposed by
above blog.

So this is my first try.

I am still a bit unsure, as Obsidian seems so good, the only thing is that I cannot
use my favorite text editor (vim, vscode, you name it).
So I am thinking maintain a same repo shared by my plain text brain and Obsidian.
